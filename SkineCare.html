<h2> Face Wash </h2>

          <p> This daily wash includes 4% benzoyl peroxide, which is gentle enough for regular use yet powerful enough to battle the nastiest pimples! The creamy cleanser, which specialists recommend, cleans and unclogs pores to eliminate existing outbreaks. When taken as part of a regular acne treatment practice, it can also help to prevent new spots from appearing. For a more gentle and moisturizing daily cleaning, the creamy recipe is tempered with emollients.

<h2>Toner</h2>

       This product has a cult following because of its exfoliating and brightening properties, which are attributed to a 5% glycolic acid content. But we think it's a good choice for folks with mixed skin (or anyone who has oily and dry patches) because it contains astringent witch hazel to absorb excess oil and moisturize aloe vera. 1 It's alcohol-free, so there's no need to worry about it drying out or peeling.

<h2>Moisturize</h2>

         Maintain supple and moisturized skin on a daily basis. The unique water gel-cream combination absorbs rapidly, like a gel, but has the long-lasting moisturizing power of cream to relieve your extra-dry skin's thirst. Gel matrix composition with liquid crystals distributes on the skin to release water and potent humectants to hydrate and lock it in for 48 hours, hydrating and moisturizing enough for most skin types.

         Tatcha can help you to take care of your skin. The Dewy Serum is a 3-in-1 skincare treatment that contains skin-loving components that hydrate, plump, and resurface the skin. The serum also contains hyaluronic acid, which helps firm the face and reduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, as well as squalene, which locks in moisture. Incorporate this creamy gel into your skincare regimen to help restore a smooth, luminous complexion.
