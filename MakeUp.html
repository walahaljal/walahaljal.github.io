     <p> Beauty Bay eyeshadow palettes are well-known for their low prices and a wide choice of colors. Although I like a lot of the Beauty Bay palettes, the Bright collection has a lot of eyeshadow colors that I don't have. So, in order to diversify my eyeshadow collection, I chose the 42-shade Beauty Bay Bright Matte Palette.

         This liquid blush (provided to you by Selena Gomez) has a learning curve for application due to its lighter texture, but it's worth it. Each cheek just only one touch of the doe-foot applicator, and it blends in well without adding any extra texture. The super-pigmented blush lasts all day and comes in both matte and dewy textures.

         This stick is easy to combine and construct. It also has a fantastic applicator: you simply tap it into the skin and mix it out with a brush, making the application a breeze. Wright previously stated regarding Charlotte Tilbury's renowned Hollywood Contour Wand, "It's extremely lightweight [and] it's suitable for all skin types and all ages, so it's not going to dry down the skin." While it's temporarily out of stock, we also recommend the brand's best-selling highlighting wand for a similarly natural shine.

         Maybelline produces some of the greatest liquid eyeliner available.  Its ability to draw a straight line. This pen has a razor-sharp tip and a comfortable grip that allows you to create smooth, even strokes.
